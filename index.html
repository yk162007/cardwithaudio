  <strong>Happy Birthday, my love!💗✨</strong><br><br>
  Wishing you a day filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable moments.<br>
  May your year be as beautiful as you are.<br>
  You are very special to me — you handle me in every situation with so much care.<br>
  You take care of me like I’m your little child.<br>
  I feel very safe and comfortable whenever you're around.<br><br>

  I miss you so much.😔<br>
  Every second without you feels like a terrible nightmare.<br>
  I hate this distance — I can't live without you, not even for a second.<br><br>

  Please don’t leave me alone in any of life’s ups and downs.<br>
  I promise I will never hurt you.<br>
  I'm trying to become a better person — just for you.<br>
  I love you, my little munchkin, my cutie, my princess, my darling.💞🩷<br>

  <em>Now, some words of wisdom 😇</em><br>
  May you land your dream job this year.<br>
  You’ll become even more successful and take me on a cute date!<br>
  And yes, this year we’re definitely going on a trip together.😉<br><br>

  Okay fine, I won’t talk too much now. 😅<br>
  but remember one thing i am with u in each and every situation <br>
  <h4><center>I LOVE U MY PILLU 💝💖 </center></h4>
